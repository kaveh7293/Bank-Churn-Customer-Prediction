# Bank-Churn-Customer-Prediction
<h3> Project Description</h3><br>
<p> In this project the goal is to identify the customers that are going to churn. We get the data set from <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers>Kaggle</a>, which contains customer features and whether they have churned the bank or they are still active members. In this data set, we can detect the future customers that are going to churn the bank, using a classification algorithm. By doing so, banks can identify the customers that are capable of leaving, and do prohibitive actions. </p>
